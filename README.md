# Mandhi-Shop-Billing-System
This project is a simple billing system for a Mandhi shop developed using Java Swing. It allows the user to add necessary items, calculate totals, and generate a final bill with GST.

## Team Members:
Bezalel Benny(24ubc225) and Joel John Benoy(24ubc237)

## Problem Statement:
In many small restaurants and Mandhi shops, billing is often done manually, which can lead to calculation errors, slow service, and inefficient record management. This project aims to develop a simple and user-friendly billing system that automates item selection, quantity input, and bill calculation using a graphical interface.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to design and implement a Mandhi Shop Billing System using Java that can be accessed by anyone:

* It Automates bill calculation
* Provides a graphical user interface for easy interaction
* Demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
* Uses Java Swing components and event handling

## Features
* User-friendly GUI interface
* Add multiple Mandhi items to the bill
* Automatic item total calculation
* GST calculation (5%)
* Generate final bill amount
* Clear/reset bill option
* Error handling for invalid input

## Technologies Used
* Java
* Java Swing (GUI)
* VS Code (IDE)
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## OOP Concepts Used
This project demonstrates the following OOP principles:
* Class and Objects (Item, BillCalculator, MandhiBillingSystem)
* Encapsulation (data stored in classes)
* Abstraction (separating calculation logic)
* Modularity (separate classes for different functionality)

## GUI Components Used
* JFrame
* JLabel
* JTextField
* JButton
* JComboBox
* JTextArea
* JScrollPane

## How to Run the Program
*Step 1: Install Java JDK.
Install Java JDK 8 or higher.
*Step 2: Open Project in VS Code
*Step 3: Compile the Program
javac MandhiBillingSystem.java in cmd 
*Step 4: Run the Program
java MandhiBillingSystem

## Sample Input and Output
Example Bill:
Chicken Mandhi x 2 = ₹500
Soft Drink x 1 = ₹50

Subtotal: ₹550
GST (5%): ₹27.5
Final Amount: ₹577.5
